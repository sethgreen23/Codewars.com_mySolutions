# VowelCount
Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
We will consider a, e, i, o, and u as vowels for this Kata.
The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

# SumTwoSmallest
Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 integers. No floats or empty arrays will be passed.
For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

# GetMiddleChar
You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

# CountingSheeps
Consider an array of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).
For example,
[True,  True,  True,  False,
  True,  True,  True,  True ,
  True,  False, True,  False,
  True,  False, False, True ,
  True,  True,  True,  True ,
  False, False, True,  True]
The correct answer would be 17.

# GrowthDurationTillTarget
Calculates the duration till a amount/number of "p0" with a growth of percent "percent" with a additional amount of "aug" reaches value "p".

# SplitStrings
Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

# RomanNumeralToInteger
Create a function that takes a Roman numeral as its argument and returns its value as a numeric decimal integer. You don't need to validate the form of the Roman numeral.

# Delete occurrences of an element if it occurs more than n times
Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering. For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].
