# VowelCount
Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
We will consider a, e, i, o, and u as vowels for this Kata.
The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

# SumTwoSmallest
Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 integers. No floats or empty arrays will be passed.
For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

# GetMiddleChar
You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

# CountingSheeps
Consider an array of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).
For example,
[True,  True,  True,  False,
  True,  True,  True,  True ,
  True,  False, True,  False,
  True,  False, False, True ,
  True,  True,  True,  True ,
  False, False, True,  True]
The correct answer would be 17.
