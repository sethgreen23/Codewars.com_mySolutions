# VowelCount
Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
We will consider a, e, i, o, and u as vowels for this Kata.
The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

# SumTwoSmallest
Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 integers. No floats or empty arrays will be passed.
For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

# GetMiddleChar
You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

# CountingSheeps
Consider an array of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).
For example,
[True,  True,  True,  False,
  True,  True,  True,  True ,
  True,  False, True,  False,
  True,  False, False, True ,
  True,  True,  True,  True ,
  False, False, True,  True]
The correct answer would be 17.

# GrowthDurationTillTarget
In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?
More generally given parameters:
p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to surpass)
the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.
aug is an integer, percent a positive or null number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)

# SplitStrings
Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').
