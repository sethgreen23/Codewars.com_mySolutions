This is my folder where I collect my code and solutions for the codewars coding challenges for JavaScript.
I just started learning JS, so the difficulty of it will increase.

# KeepHydrated
Nathan loves cycling. Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling. You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

# SmallestInteger
Return smallest integer in array.

# ReversedString
Takes a String as parameter and returns it reversed.

# ComplementaryDNA
In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

# CountingDoubles
Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.
- Example: "aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)

# JadenCasingStrings
Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word.
Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them. Example:
- Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
- Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

# EqualSidesOfArray
You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

# MiddleCharacter
Write a function which returns the middle character of a string if the string has a odd length - and the middle two chars if it has even length.

# FindOddInt
Given an array, find the int that appears an odd number of times. There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

# OddOrEven
Return "Odd" if the given int is odd or "Even" if the given int is even.

# VowelCount
Count vowel-letter appearance (vowel: a, e, i, o, u) - Capital

# Highest&Lowest
In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

# ShortestWord
Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s). String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.
