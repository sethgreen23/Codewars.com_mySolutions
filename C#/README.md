This is my folder where I collect my code and solutions for the codewars coding challenges for C#. I just started learning C#, so the difficulty of it will increase.

# FindTheStrayNumber
You are given an odd-length array of integers, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number. Complete the method which accepts such an array, and returns that single different number.

# DetectPangram
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

# ConvertBoolToYesAndNo
Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a "Yes" string for true, or a "No" string for false.

# Vasya-Clerk
The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.
Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.
Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line? Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.
